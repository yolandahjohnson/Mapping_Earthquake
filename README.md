# Mapping_Earthquake
 
## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake. Additionally, the map will show earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and three diffrently styled maps. 

## Results: Interactive Maps
